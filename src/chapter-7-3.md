Addressing unconscious bias in the workplace is essential for creating a work environment that values and respects all individuals. In this chapter, we will explore strategies for creating awareness and promoting education around unconscious bias.

Defining Unconscious Bias
-------------------------

Unconscious bias refers to attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions without us realizing it. Some common types of unconscious bias include:

* Affinity bias: favoring people who are similar to oneself
* Confirmation bias: seeking out information that confirms existing beliefs and biases
* Halo/horns effect: attributing positive/negative traits based on overall perception

By understanding the different types of unconscious bias, individuals can become more aware of their own biases and work to overcome them.
